# Understanding Deep learning with Kernel Learning

This repositery serves as the code for experiments on kernel learning following the article : https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01396

In the main.py file, to run the experiment you can select the training size of the data as well as the noise level. You can also chose which type of data you would like to experiments with (synthetic data, MNIST, CIFAR...)
